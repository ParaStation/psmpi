= Installation

== Configure ParaStation MPI

Download the source code from GitHub:

[,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/ParaStation/psmpi.git psmpi
----

Run Autotools:

[,console]
----
$ cd /path/to/psmpi
$ ./autogen.sh
----

We encourage you *not* to build ParaStation MPI directly within the main source
folder:

[,console]
----
$ mkdir build && cd build
----

ParaStation MPI relies on Autotools as the build system requiring a configure
step. The build system already provides so-called "confsets" that pass the
necessary configuration arguments for a particular installation type to the
underlying MPICH build system. It is strongly recommended to rely on these
confsets for a proper installation! Currently, the following confsets are
provided:

[,console]
----
default    : Like 'gcc'
none       : Do not configure mpich. Prepare only for tar, rpm and srpm build

gcc        : Use Gnu compiler (gcc)
intel      : Use Intel compiler (icx)
icx        : Like 'intel'
pgi        : Portland group compiler (pgcc)
nvhpc      : Nvidia HPC compiler (nvc)
llvm       : llvm-based toolchains (e.g., AOCC)

devel      : With error checking and debug info (gcc)
debug      : Like 'devel' but without any optimizations

user       : No predefined options
ch3        : original mpich ch3 device (no parastation)
ch4        : original mpich ch4 device (no parastation)
----

The following example configures ParaStation MPI for using the gcc compiler:

[,console]
----
$ ../configure --prefix=/path/to/installation/dir --with-confset=default
----

We recommend developers to use the `devel` confset for more error checking and debug infos at compile time.

| `--enable-debug-mode`
| disabled
| Enable debug mode (same as `--with-confset=debug` for psp device with gcc)
|===

== Build ParaStation MPI
For a successful build, you have to provide a path to your pscom installation via the
`--with-pscom[=path]` configure option (defaults to `/opt/parastation`) or alternatively by setting
the `LIBRARY_PATH` and `CPATH` environment variables:

[,console]
----
$ export LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/pscom/installation/lib[64]:${LIBRARY_PATH}
$ export CPATH=/path/to/pscom/installation/include:${CPATH}
----

Now, ParaStation MPI can be built and installed in accordance with the
configuration arguments:

[,console]
----
$ make -j8 && make install
----

== Prepare the environment
To use ParaStation MPI for building and running MPI applications, it is
advisable to adjust the environment properly. This can be done, e.g.,  by using
the following bash script:
[,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Please provide the path to ParaStation MPI. Abort!"
    exit -1
fi

PARASTATION_MPI=`realpath ${1}`

export PATH="${PARASTATION_MPI}/bin${PATH:+:}${PATH}"
export CPATH="${PARASTATION_MPI}/include${CPATH:+:}${CPATH}"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${PARASTATION_MPI}/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:}${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
export LIBRARY_PATH="${PARASTATION_MPI}/lib${LIBRARY_PATH:+:}${LIBRARY_PATH}"
----

== Alternative Installation

Instead of relying on the pscom as a shared-library, ParaStation MPI can be
optionally compiled as a single shared-object by directly using the pscom
sources. For doing so, the pscom source files are required:

[,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/ParaStation/pscom.git pscom
----

After downloading the psmpi sources, the same
configuration parameters apply as discussed above (see <<{configuration-anchor}>>).
Additionally, you will need to add the `--with-pscom-allin` flag, e.g.:

[,console]
----
$ ../configure --prefix=/path/to/installation/dir --with-confset=default --with-pscom-allin=/path/to/pscom/sources
----

By default, the pscom4ucp as well as the pscom4psm plugins are included
firmly into ParaStation MPI if `--with-pscom-allin` is set and the related
low-level drivers are found. For specifying the plugins to be built-in
explicitly, the `--with-pscom-builtin[=list]` option can be used.
