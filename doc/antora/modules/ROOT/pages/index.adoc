As shown in the figure above, ParaStation MPI relies on the low-level communication layer https://github.com/parastation/pscom[pscom] for the implementation of the PSP Device on the ADI-Layer of the MPICH architecture.
ParaStation MPI provides full MPI-4 compliance including support for the MPI Sessions model.
Furthermore, the Process Management Interface for Exascale (PMIx) is supported as interface to the process manager.
