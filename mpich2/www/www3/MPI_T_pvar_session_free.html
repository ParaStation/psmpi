Free an existing performance variable session 
<H2>Synopsis</H2>
<PRE>
int MPI_T_pvar_session_free(MPI_T_pvar_session *session)
</PRE>
<H2>Input/Output Parameters</H2>
<DL><DT><B>session </B> <DD> identifier of performance experiment session (handle)
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Notes</H2>
Calls to the MPI tool information interface can no longer be made
within the context of a session after it is freed. On a successful
return, MPI sets the session identifier to MPI_T_PVAR_SESSION_NULL.
<P>
<H2>Thread and Interrupt Safety</H2>
<P>
This routine is thread-safe.  This means that this routine may be
safely used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided
thread locks.  However, the routine is not interrupt safe.  Typically,
this is due to the use of memory allocation routines such as <TT>malloc
</TT>or other non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
<P>
<H2>Errors</H2>
<P>
All MPI routines (except <TT>MPI_Wtime</TT> and <TT>MPI_Wtick</TT>) return an error value;
C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last
argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.  The error handler
may be changed with <TT>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</TT> (for communicators),
<TT>MPI_File_set_errhandler</TT> (for files), and <TT>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</TT> (for
RMA windows).  The MPI-1 routine <TT>MPI_Errhandler_set</TT> may be used but
its use is deprecated.  The predefined error handler
<TT>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</TT> may be used to cause error values to be returned.
Note that MPI does <EM>not</EM> guarentee that an MPI program can continue past
an error; however, MPI implementations will attempt to continue whenever
possible.
<P>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_SUCCESS </B> <DD> No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_T_ERR_NOT_INITIALIZED </B> <DD> The MPI tool information interface is not initialized.
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_T_ERR_INVALID_SESSION </B> <DD> Session argument is not valid.
