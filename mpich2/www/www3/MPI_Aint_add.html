<H2>Notes</H2>
MPI_Aint_Add produces a new MPI_Aint value that is equivalent to the sum of the
base and disp arguments, where base represents a base address returned by a call
to MPI_GET_ADDRESS and disp represents a signed integer displacement. The resulting
address is valid only at the process that generated base, and it must correspond
to a location in the same object referenced by base. The addition is performed in
a manner that results in the correct MPI_Aint representation of the output address,
as if the process that originally produced base had called:

    MPI_Get_address((char *) base + disp, &amp;result)
