.SH NAME
.PP
fi_opx \- The Omni\-Path Express Fabric Provider
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The OPX provider is a native implementation of the libfabric interfaces
that makes direct use of Omni\-Path fabrics as well as libfabric
acceleration features.
The purpose of this provider is to show the scalability and performance
of libfabric, providing an \[lq]extreme scale\[rq] development
environment for applications and middleware using the libfabric API, and
to support a functional and performant version of MPI on Omni\-Path
fabrics.
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES
.PP
The OPX provider supports most features defined for the libfabric API.
.PP
Key features include:
.TP
.B Endpoint types
The Omni\-Path HFI hardware is connectionless and reliable.
The OPX provider only supports the \f[I]FI_EP_RDM\f[R] endpoint type.
.TP
.B Capabilities
Supported capabilities include \f[I]FI_MSG\f[R], \f[I]FI_RMA,
\f[R]FI_TAGGED\f[I], \f[R]FI_ATOMIC\f[I], \f[R]FI_NAMED_RX_CTX\f[I],
\f[R]FI_SOURCE\f[I], \f[R]FI_SEND\f[I], \f[R]FI_RECV\f[I],
\f[R]FI_MULTI_RECV\f[I], \f[R]FI_DIRECTED_RECV\f[I], \f[R]FI_SOURCE*.
.PP
Notes on \f[I]FI_DIRECTED_RECV\f[R] capability: The immediate data which
is sent within the \[lq]senddata\[rq] call to support
\f[I]FI_DIRECTED_RECV\f[R] for OPX must be exactly 4 bytes, which OPX
uses to completely identify the source address to an exascale\-level
number of ranks for tag matching on the recv and can be managed within
the MU packet.
Therefore the domain attribute \[lq]cq_data_size\[rq] is set to 4 which
is the OFI standard minimum.
.TP
.B Modes
Two modes are defined: \f[I]FI_CONTEXT2\f[R] and \f[I]FI_ASYNC_IOV\f[R].
The OPX provider requires \f[I]FI_CONTEXT2\f[R].
.TP
.B Additional features
Supported additional features include \f[I]FABRIC_DIRECT\f[R],
\f[I]scalable endpoints\f[R], and \f[I]counters\f[R].
.TP
.B Progress
Only \f[I]FI_PROGRESS_MANUAL\f[R] is supported.
.TP
.B Address vector
Only the \f[I]FI_AV_MAP\f[R] address vector format is supported.
.TP
.B Memory registration modes
Only \f[I]FI_MR_SCALABLE\f[R] is supported.
.SH UNSUPPORTED FEATURES
.TP
.B Endpoint types
Unsupported endpoint types include \f[I]FI_EP_DGRAM\f[R] and
\f[I]FI_EP_MSG\f[R].
.TP
.B Capabilities
The OPX provider does not support \f[I]FI_RMA_EVENT\f[R] and
\f[I]FI_TRIGGER\f[R] capabilities.
.TP
.B Address vector
The OPX provider does not support the \f[I]FI_AV_TABLE\f[R] address
vector format.
This may be added in the future.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
As OPX is under development this list of limitations is subject to
change.
.PP
It runs under the following MPI versions:
.PP
Intel MPI from Parallel Studio 2020, update 4.
Intel MPI from OneAPI 2021, update 3.
Open MPI 4.1.2a1 (Older version of Open MPI will not work).
MPICH 3.4.2.
.PP
Currently, this provider is PIO\-only.
SDMA is not supported at this time.
.PP
Usage:
.PP
If using with OpenMPI 4.1.x, disable UCX and openib transports.
OPX is not compatible with Open MPI 4.1.x PML/BTL.
DMA, RDMA and SDMA are not implemented.
Performance falls off when using message sizes larger than 1 MTU (4K max
size).
Shared memory is not cleaned up after an application crashes.
Use \[dq]rm \-rf /dev/shm/*\[dq] to remove old shared\-memory files.
.SH RUNTIME PARAMETERS
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_OPX_UUID\f[R]
OPX requires a unique ID for each job.
In order for all processes in a job to communicate with each other, they
require to use the same UUID.
This variable can be set with FI_OPX_UUID=${RANDOM} The default UUID is
00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_OPX_RELIABILITY_SERVICE_USEC_MAX\f[R]
This setting controls how frequently the reliability/replay function
will issue PING requests to a remote connection.
Reducing this value may improve performance at the expense of increased
traffic on the OPX fabric.
Default setting is 500.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_OPX_RELIABILITY_SERVICE_PRE_ACK_RATE\f[R]
This setting controls how frequently a receiving rank will send ACKs for
packets it has received without being prompted through a PING request.
A non\-zero value N tells the receiving rank to send an ACK for the last
N packets every Nth packet.
Used in conjunction with an increased value for
FI_OPX_RELIABILITY_SERVICE_USEC_MAX may improve performance.
.PP
Valid values are 0 (disabled) and powers of 2 in the range of 1\-32,768,
inclusive.
.PP
Default setting is 64.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_OPX_HFI_SELECT\f[R]
Controls how OPX chooses which HFI to use when opening a context.
Has two forms: \- \f[C]<hfi\-unit>\f[R] Force OPX provider to use
\f[C]hfi\-unit\f[R].
\- \f[C]<selector1>[,<selector2>[,...,<selectorN>]]\f[R] Select HFI
based on first matching \f[C]selector\f[R]
.PP
Where \f[C]selector\f[R] is one of the following forms: \-
\f[C]default\f[R] to use the default logic \-
\f[C]fixed:<hfi\-unit>\f[R] to fix to one \f[C]hfi\-unit\f[R] \-
\f[C]<selector\-type>:<hfi\-unit>:<selector\-data>\f[R]
.PP
The above fields have the following meaning: \- \f[C]selector\-type\f[R]
The selector criteria the caller opening the context is evaluated
against.
\- \f[C]hfi\-unit\f[R] The HFI to use if the caller matches the
selector.
\- \f[C]selector\-data\f[R] Data the caller must match (e.g.\ NUMA node
ID).
.PP
Where \f[C]selector\-type\f[R] is one of the following: \-
\f[C]numa\f[R] True when caller is local to the NUMA node ID given by
\f[C]selector\-data\f[R].
\- \f[C]core\f[R] True when caller is local to the CPU core given by
\f[C]selector\-data\f[R].
.PP
And \f[C]selector\-data\f[R] is one of the following: \- \f[C]value\f[R]
The specific value to match \- \f[C]<range\-start>\-<range\-end>\f[R]
Matches with any value in that range
.PP
In the second form, when opening a context, OPX uses the
\f[C]hfi\-unit\f[R] of the first\-matching selector.
Selectors are evaluated left\-to\-right.
OPX will return an error if the caller does not match any selector.
.PP
In either form, it is an error if the specified or selected HFI is not
in the Active state.
In this case, OPX will return an error and execution will not continue.
.PP
With this option, it is possible to cause OPX to try to open more
contexts on an HFI than there are free contexts on that HFI.
In this case, one or more of the context\-opening calls will fail and
OPX will return an error.
For the second form, as which HFI is selected depends on properties of
the caller, deterministic HFI selection requires deterministic caller
properties.
E.g.
for the \f[C]numa\f[R] selector, if the caller can migrate between NUMA
domains, then HFI selection will not be deterministic.
.PP
The logic used will always be the first valid in a selector list.
For example, \f[C]default\f[R] and \f[C]fixed\f[R] will match all
callers, so if either are in the beginning of a selector list, you will
only use \f[C]fixed\f[R] or \f[C]default\f[R] regardles of if there are
any more selectors.
.PP
Examples: \- \f[C]FI_OPX_HFI_SELECT=1\f[R] all callers will open
contexts on HFI 0.
\- \f[C]FI_OPX_HFI_SELECT=numa:0:0,numa:1:1,numa:0:2,numa:1:3\f[R]
callers local to NUMA nodes 0 and 2 will use HFI 0, callers local to
NUMA domains 1 and 3 will use HFI 1.
\- \f[C]FI_OPX_HFI_SELECT=numa:0:0\-3,default\f[R] callers local to NUMA
nodes 0 thru 3 (including 0 and 3) will use HFI 0, and all else will use
default selection logic.
\- \f[C]FI_OPX_HFI_SELECT=core:1:0,fixed:0\f[R] callers local to CPU
core 0 will use HFI 1, and all others will use HFI 0.
\- \f[C]FI_OPX_HFI_SELECT=default,core:1:0\f[R] all callers will use
default HFI selection logic.
