- Added ucp_rkey_ptr() to obtain pointer for shared memory region
- Avoid progress overhead on unused transports
- Improved scalability of software tag-matching by using a hash table
- Added transparent huge-pages allocator

- Added registration cache for knem
- Initial support for Java bindings
Bugfixes:
- Multiple bugfixes (full list on githib)
Tested configurations:
- InfiniBand: MLNX_OFED 4.2, inbox OFED drivers.
- CUDA: gdrcopy 1.2, cuda 9.1.85
- XPMEM: 2.6.2
- KNEM: 1.1.2
Known issues:
  #2047 - UCP: ucp_do_am_bcopy_multi drops data on UCS_ERROR_NO_RESOURCE
  #2047 - failure in ud/uct_flush_test.am_zcopy_flush_ep_nb/1
  #2025 - Data corruption on some ARM machines
  #1977 - failure in shm/test_ucp_rma.blocking_small/0
  #1926 - Timeout in mpi_test_suite with HW TM
  #1920 - transport retry count exceeded in many-to-one tests
  #1689 - Segmentation fault on memory hooks test in jenkins


## 1.2.2 (January 4, 2018)

Main:
- Support including UCX API headers from C++ code
- UD transport to handle unicast flood on RoCE fabric
- Compilation fixes for gcc 7.1.1, clang 3.6, clang 5

Details:
- When UD transport is used with RoCE, packets intended for other peers may
  arrive on different adapters (as a result of unicast flooding).
- This change adds packet filtering based on destination GIDs. Now the packet
  is silently dropped, if its destination GID does not match the local GID.
- Added a new device ID for InfiniBand HCA
- [packaging] Move `examples/` and `perftest/` into doc
- [packaging] Update spec to work on old distros while complaint with Fedora
  guidelines
- [cleanup] Removed unused ptmalloc version (2.83)
- [cleanup] Fixup license headers

## 1.2.1 (August 28, 2017)

- Compilation fixes for gcc 7.1
- Spec file cleanups
- Versioning cleanups
