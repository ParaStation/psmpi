# This file lists new API functions that will be standardized in the
# next MPI specification. Because they are not standardized yet, we
# need use the MPIX_ prefix rather than the MPI_ prefix. And when they
# eventually get standardized, we'll need convert them back to MPI_
# prefix. Rather than manually do the conversion, we list the functions
# here so they can be easily scripted.

# maint/local_python/mpi_api.py will load this file and add a "mpix"
# key to the api function, which will generate the interface with MPIX_
# prefix. The binding scripts runs at autogen time.

# A separate script will load this file and sweep test/mpi tests and
# replace all MPI_ with MPIX_ for the listed function. The script will
# be run once (the result commit to the repository) and run again once
# the function get standardized with the reverse option. There is no
# side effects to run the script multiple times.
