.SH NAME
MPI_Aint_add \-  Returns the sum of base and disp 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
MPI_Aint MPI_Aint_add(MPI_Aint base, MPI_Aint disp)
.fi
.SH INPUT PARAMETERS
.PD 0
.TP
.B base 
- base address (integer)
.PD 1
.PD 0
.TP
.B disp 
- displacement (integer)
.PD 1

.SH RETURN VALUE
Sum of the base and disp argument

.SH NOTES
MPI_Aint_Add produces a new MPI_Aint value that is equivalent to the sum of the
base and disp arguments, where base represents a base address returned by a call
to MPI_GET_ADDRESS and disp represents a signed integer displacement. The resulting
address is valid only at the process that generated base, and it must correspond
to a location in the same object referenced by base. The addition is performed in
a manner that results in the correct MPI_Aint representation of the output address,
as if the process that originally produced base had called:
.nf
MPI_Get_address((char *) base + disp, &result)
.fi
