# Code Coverage Reports

The following links show how much of the code is covered by our various
test suites (mpich1, mpich2, intel, cxx, io) as reported by
[`gcov`](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov-Intro.html). For more
information on code coverage, see [Wikipedia's article on the
subject](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage).
